Hospital Re-admission is an episode when a patient who had been discharged from a hospital is admitted again within a specified time interval. 
Re-admission rates have increasingly been used as an outcome measure in health services and as a quality benchmark for health systems.
For this reason, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services established the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program which aims to improve quality of care for patients and reduce healthcare spending by applying payment penalties to hospitals that have more than expected readmission rates for certain conditions.
Our Project aims to study the factors affecting re-admission and build a predictive model using Machine Learning Techniques with the given dataset and its limited features.
The model is then assessed using the sklearn.metric scores like accuracy, precision, recall, AUC. 
The Feature Importance highlights the factors majorly contributing to readmission for the given data.
Being able to predict which patients will get re-admitted can help hospitals save millions of dollars while improving quality of care.
